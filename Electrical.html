	<p>The department of Electrical & Electronics Engg., was started in the year 1979. The department conducts four year 
	Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical & Electronics Engg degree course affiliated to
	Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi. The course content includes the basics of 
	Electrical Engineering and an exhaustive treatment on Electrical Machines, Electrical Networks,
	Electrical Power Systems, Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution, Computer Aided Stability and 
	Load Flow analysis. The course also gives a substantial exposure to Analog & Digital Electronics,
	Power Electronics and Computer System and applications. The department offers and carries out projects
	in the conventional and relevant thrust areas of technology. Many of the projects undertaken by the department
	have been consistently sponsored by KSCST, Bengaluru. Under MODROB scheme (a scheme by central Govt. India) a
	well equipped laboratory in Power Electronics has been setup. The department has full pledged laboratories to
	meet the requirements of University curriculum. The department offers consultancy services to meet the industrial
	needs in testing, calibration and High voltage testings. The department has well qualified staff with expertise in 
	Power Systems, Electronics and Computer Applications, assisted by skilled supporting staff. 
	Electrical Engineering Association, a departmental organization provides a platform for students to exhibit 
	their talents in various extra curricular activities. The students graduated from our dept have been securing 
	good placements in Electrical Industries and Electronics and Computer fields.</p>
